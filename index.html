			<article>First let's talk about Windows this operating system is developed by Microsoft Corporation, and it`s a closed
				source, and that is mean nobody can develop this operating except Microsoft Corporation, Mac OS it`s like Windows I mean
				it`s closed source, but it has deferent application support, and deferent GUI, finally Linux operating System it`s totally
				different from Windows, and Mac OS because it`s open-source which mean anybody can develop it, for this reason, it`s
				preferred by many developers</article>
